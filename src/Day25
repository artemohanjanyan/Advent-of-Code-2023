I visualised the graph using graphviz,
then tweaked some parameters (removed edges, set node size to the minimum),
exported the image as svg,
manually further reduced point thickness in svg,
opened the image in GIMP,
selected x=2300 coordinate that splits graph into two parts,
saved as PNG,
opened it in gnu octave,
calculated the proportion of non-white pixels to the left of 2300
to find the number of nodes on the left.

Octave code:

img = imread("path to png");
left=img(:,1:2300,:);
q1=nnz(255-left);
q=nnz(255-img);
leftNumber=round(totalNumber*q1/q);
rightNumber=totalNumber-leftNumber;
leftNumber*rightNumber
